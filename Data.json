      "question": "What is the difference between GSM and CDMA mobile network technologies?",
      "answer": "GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) are two different cellular network technologies. GSM uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) to share the available frequency channels among multiple users, while CDMA uses a unique coding scheme to differentiate users on the same frequency channel. Some key differences include: \n* Frequency allocation: GSM divides the available spectrum into fixed time slots, while CDMA uses spreading codes to assign unique channels to each user.\n* Call quality: GSM generally offers better voice quality, while CDMA has an advantage in data transmission speed.\n* Security: Both technologies offer encryption, but GSM uses a different and potentially less secure algorithm compared to CDMA.\n* Coverage: GSM generally has wider coverage, especially in rural areas, compared to CDMA."

      "question": "What is the role of a fiber optic cable in telecommunication?",
      "answer": "Fiber optic cables use thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit light pulses instead of electrical signals. This offers several advantages over traditional copper cables, including: \n* Higher bandwidth: Fiber optic cables can carry much more data than copper cables, making them ideal for high-speed internet, video streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive applications.\n* Lower signal loss: Light signals in fiber optic cables travel with minimal loss over long distances, unlike electrical signals in copper cables that weaken over time.\n* Immunity to interference: Fiber optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can disrupt signals in copper cables.\n* Security: Data transmitted through fiber optic cables is more difficult to intercept compared to copper cables."
